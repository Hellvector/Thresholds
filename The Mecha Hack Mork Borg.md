# The Mecha Hack / Mork Borg

## Abilities

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Agility** | Defend, balance, swim, flee |
| **Presence** | Perceive, aim, charm, wield Powers |
| **Strength** | Crush, lift, strike, grapple |
| **Toughness** | Resist poison/cold/heat, survive falling |

ROLL 3D6 AND USE THE TABLE BELOW to generate each ability score from -3 to +3. The sum is not used in the game once the character is created, only the table value.

| Abilities |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | -3  |
| 5-6 | -2  |
| 7-8 | -1  |
| 9-12 | +0  |
| 13-14 | +1  |
| 15-16 | +2  |
| 17-20 | +3  |

## Tests

TESTS ARE MADE AGAINST A DIFFICULTY RATING. To succeed roll D20 + your ability with a result equal to or greater than the DR. Creatures don't use abilities, they just roll a D20 against DR. 

| | DIFFICULTY RATINGS (DR) |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | so simple people laugh at you for failing |
| 8 | routine but some chance of failure |
| 10 | pretty simple but not simple enough to not roll |
| 12 | normal |
| 14 | difficult |
| 16 | really hard |
| 18 | should not be possible |
