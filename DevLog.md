# Development Log

## Latest Entry

- Continued compiling rules terminology from the _Cairn_ and _Liminal Horror_ SRDs.
- Pulled in some new reference information from the game _Teenage Odyssey_, specifically how their choice to combine STR and DEX into a single stat called **Body** aligned with my plan. They also maintained a **Mind** stat, which is missing from many other _Into the Odd_ and _Cairn_ based games.
- Current progress expanded from the tail end of Character Creation to the Rules Summary at the end of the _Cairn SRD_.
- Changed references of a Warden to use GM instead.
- Currently need to complete the options for Backgrounds and Labels, and their respective gear and skills.
- Also need to insert the list of character descriptor tables, along with the group relationship tables.
