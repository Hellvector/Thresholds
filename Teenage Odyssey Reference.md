## Roll Stats
During **Character Creation**, roll your three **Stats**: **Body**, **Mind**, and **Charm**. To determine the **Current** and **Max** value of these **Stats**, roll 2d6+6 three times and assign those rolled numbers to **Body**, **Mind**, and **Charm** as you see fit. These rolled **Stats** are applied to both your **Current** and **Max** **Stats**.

### Body

The **Body Stat** covers any physical actions your **Character** might take. This includes feats of might, stealth, acrobatics, or just trying to do a really sick wheelie on your bike. Also, when your **HP** is depleted any additional **Damage** you take reduces your **Current Body Stat**. Once your **Current Body** is reduced to zero your **Character** dies.

Recovering **Damage** inflicted to your **Body Stat** is covered later. Your **Body Stat** generally can never be increased beyond your **Starting Body Stat**, but there are situations where your **Body Stat** can be increased either temporarily or permanently above your **Starting Body Stat** value.

### Mind

The **Mind Stat** covers any mental endeavor your **Character** takes. From discerning puzzles, noticing things out of the ordinary, hacking a computer, picking a lock, or making sense of the world around them. Additionally, any **Fear** your **Character** suffers is subtracted from your **Current Mind Stat**. When your **Current Mind Stat** is reduced to zero, your **Character** suffers a bout of madness, which could be temporary, permanent, or something that renders your **Character** permanently unplayable. 

Recovering **Damage** inflicted to your **Mind Stat** is covered later. Your **Mind Stat** generally can never be increased beyond your **Starting Mind Stat** value, but there are some situations where your **Mind Stat** can be increased either temporarily or permanently above your **Starting Mind Stat** value. 

### Charm

The **Charm Stat** covers interpersonal skills. This can range from intimidation attempts, distracting someone, flirtations, appearing cute and unassuming, or smooth talking your way out of trouble. Unlike the other **Stats**, there is nothing that can reduce your **Charm**. There are some situations where your **Charm Stat** can be increased either temporarily or permanently above your **Starting Charm Stat** value.
