**Thresholds** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality  
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless  
A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First  
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Growth  
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice  
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles  
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens
> [!caution]
> Copied directly from the Cairn SRD.
### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do,and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus  
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger  
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure  
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice  
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate  
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge,etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players
> [!caution]
> Copied directly from the Cairn SRD.
### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation
> [!missing]
> This section is very much a work in progress.

**Name, Age and Background**
The first thing you need to decide when making your character is their age, or more specifically, if they are a **Teen** or an **Adult**. 
> [!caution]
> Consider inserting a roll to randomly determine which age group the player character. Something with a bit more weight than a simple coin flip, probably biasing toward an Adult.

#### Teen
When creating a teenager, choose an age between 11 and 18, or roll (1d8+10).
> [!note]
> Possibly adjust this spectrum to be 12-19 (1d8+11).

Next, choose or roll for your **_Label_** to determine your starting equipment and relevant skills.

> [!caution]
> Consider a Teen getting an attribute adjustment: +3 to Heart, -1 to Mind, -2 to Body.
> 
> Actually, the same concept could be built into *Tags* applied to the individual Label that a Teen starts with. This would allow Advantage/Disadvantage to handle the heavy lifting of the idea without a numerical modifier that doesn't account for the differentiation between say **Strength** and **Speed**, which are both governed by the **Body** attribute score. 

#### Adult
When creating an adult character, choose an age between 18 and 56, or roll (2d20+16).

Next, choose or roll for your **Background** to determine your starting equipment and relevant skills.

#### Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**BODY**, **MIND**, and **HEART**. When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

**Example:**
Dani rolls for their character's **BODY**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **MIND** and a **13** for **HEART**. They decide to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 BODY**, **12 MIND** and **13 HEART**.

### Stamina

> [!caution]
> Changing Hit Protection to Stamina. This will help further separate from the idea that HP equates health and the literal vitality of a character. It also then makes more sense that a character can recover their **Stamina** with just a few short minutes of rest, while attribute damage takes longer to recover. Will need to rework the text a bit and possibly rename the **Scars**.

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **STAMINA**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. **STAMINA** does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's **STAMINA** exactly to 0, the player must roll on the **Scars** table.

#### Inventory
> [!caution]
> Mostly copied from the Cairn SRD.

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency pillow, provided its contents aren't _too_ lumpy.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 **STAMINA**.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. 

#### Starting Gear

**Money:**
> [!caution]
> Consider moving the starting gear section?

A Teen will start with (1d8x10) $USD.

An Adult will start with (2d20x10) $USD.

> [!note]
> These die values are tied to the same dice rolled to determine the character's age. If the age die for a Teen gets changed to 1d10, this will also need to be updated.

> [!caution]
> Is there anything considered to be standard enough that virtually all characters would have said items on them upon creation?

## Name & Background (d20)

> [!caution]
> Does it make sense to include a table of Male and Female names to help players come up with something, or is the modern world reasonably familiar enough that players can be expected to handle that on their own?

## Rules
> [!missing]
> This section is still a work in progress. 

**Abilities**  
Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

**Strength (STR**): Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX):** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
> [!note]
> **Body:** Used for saves requiring physical capability, including feats of both strength and speed. Lifting, bending, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, resisting poison, etc.

**Willpower** (WIL): Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.
> [!note]
> **Mind:** Used for saves requiring mental prowess, including both knowledge and intuition. Solving puzzles, spotting differences, picking locks, discerning illusion from reality, resisting charms, etc.

> [!note]
> **Heart:** Used for saves requiring inner fortitude, including acts of both courage and compassion.

**Saves**  
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll _equal to or under that ability score_, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

> [!caution]
> Update the example to fit the implied setting.

**Example:** _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!_

**Deprivation & Fatigue**  
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover **Stamina** or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).  
PCs can also gain Fatigue through events in the fiction.

**Healing**  
Resting for a few moments to catch your breath will restore lost **Stamina**, but leaves the PCs exposed. Ability loss takes longer to recover from. It can take as much as a week's rest and could require the aid of a medical professional or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services may be free, while more expedient recovery may come at a cost.

**Armor**  
Before calculating damage to **Stamina**, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Equipment can provide a bonus to defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is appropriately held or worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  

**Reactions**  
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the GM may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

**Morale**  
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

**Hirelings**  
PCs can hire **hirelings** to aid them in their expeditions. To create a hireling, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out. Hirelings cost between 1-3gp per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

**Wealth & Treasure**  
The most common coin is the gold piece (gp), which is equal to 10 silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages,strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
