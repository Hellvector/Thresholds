## Overview

### Design Philosophy

**Neutrality.** The Warden’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Classless.** A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.

**Death.** Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

**Fiction first.** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth.** Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player choice.** Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles.** The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

**Shared objectives.** Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

#### Adventures

What type of adventures can a player character expect?

- **Defend** a village against roving bandits
- **Hunt** a monstrous machine stealing children
- **Reclaim** an underground base swarming with mutants
- **Retrieve** a powerful gun lost in the mountains
- **Confront** a raging colossus blocking supplies reaching an isolated settlement
- **Broker** peace between two warring factions
- **Protect** a caravan journey travelling through dangerous territory
- **Infiltrate** a secretive cult worshipping forgotten gods
- **Explore** other worlds via lost slip doors

## Principles

### Principles for Wardens

#### Information

- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions

#### Difficulty

- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics
- If something the player wants to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions

#### Preparation

- The game world is organic, malleable and random — it intuits and makes sharp turns
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality

#### Narrative Focus

- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path
- A bullet to the head will kill you, regardless of your expensive gear and impressive training

#### Danger

- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world

#### Treasure

- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes

#### Choice

- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague
- Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world

#### Die of Fate

- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.)
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 3 or less generally favours the players
- A roll of 4 or more tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies

### Principles for Players

#### Agency

- Attributes and related saves do not define your character — they are tools
- Don’t ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections

#### Teamwork

- Seek consensus from the other players before barrelling forward
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone

#### Exploration

- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have
- Take the Warden’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away from seeking more information
- There is no single correct way forward

#### Talking

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems
- You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent

#### Caution

- Pulling iron is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals
- Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavourable

#### Planning

- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives

#### Ambition

- Set goals and use your meagre means to take steps forward
- Expect nothing — earn your reputation
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens

#### Defeat

- If one path leads to defeat, try another
- Some obstacles cannot be overcome immediately
- With every defeat comes new knowledge and opportunities

### Principles of The Drifted World

#### The World Has Moved On

- Forces once thought immutable shift and the borders of time and space grow thin — opposing realms bleed into ours, creating pathways in reality
- The old ways bubble to the surface, bringing with them chaos and madness

#### The Gunslingers

- Once a symbol of order and feudal authority, now only a few remain
- The guns they carry remain a powerful sigil and mark them as Gunslingers

#### Secrets

- Secrets are worth seeking out but all are well guarded and dangerous
- Some mysteries will never be solved

#### Technology

- Remnants of the world that was lay abandoned everywhere, most broken and corrupted
- Vast machinery stirs underground, driving the gears of reality

#### Magical Knowledge

- The knowledge of most magic is lost and the use of magic draws unwanted attention
- Magic is wild and unpredictable, with behaviour changing from one world to another

#### The Slip Doors

- Gateways between worlds, some forever lost and others in plain sight
- Pierce time and space but only open for the right hand

#### Death

- The clearing at the end of the path
- Spirits gather in places of the dead
- Only a corpse may speak true prophecy
- Death is but a door and may lead to other worlds than these

### Content and Safety Tools

**We Deal in Lead** is a game built around guns and gunslingers, set in a dark fantasy world and touches on topics of violence, revenge, horror, death, sacrifice, and gore.

The following distressing themes may occur in play:

- Animal peril ([beast companions](#beast-companions))
- Player versus player conflict ([opposing quests](#the-quest) and [sacrifice](#sacrifice))
- Slavery, colonialism, and genocide

Have a discussion with everyone around the table and agree on what content should and shouldn't be included in your game. Consider safety tools like the X card and lines/veils to ensure everyone is comfortable, having fun, and has the support they need.

## Gunslinger Creation

### **Name, Background & Traits**

First, choose or roll a **first name** and **surname** for your character from the [**Name & Background**](#name--background) tables and decide what **pronouns** they'd use. Next, choose or roll their **background**, which informs their knowledge and potential skills.

Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance, speech, reputation, etc.) on the [**Character Traits**](#character-traits-d10) tables.

Consider whether they're from the Drifted World or have arrived here through a Slip Door from another world.

Now roll for their **age** (4d12+10).

Finally, to determine your gunslinger's weapon, choose or roll on the [**Artefact Guns**](#artefact-guns-d6) table and [**Gun Embellishments**](#gun-embellishments) table.

### Ability Scores

Roll **3d6** for each ability in order, swap any two.

**Strength (STR)**: Brawn, prowess & resistance.

**Dexterity (DEX)**: Agility, sneaking & reflexes.

**Heart (HRT)**: Persuasion, intimidation, & force of will.

### Grit
Gunslingers must be more courageous and resilient than others in the Drifted World. Roll **2d6** to determine your starting **Grit**, your capacity to endure and survive in a world that's moved on. Grit does not indicate your health or fortitude; nor do you lose it for very long (see **Healing**).

If an attack takes your Grit exactly to 0, you must roll on the **Scars** table.

### Starting Gear
All characters begin with:

- 3 days' rations (1 slot)
- A torch (1 slot)
- 3d6 Lead (1 slot)

Roll on the [**Starting Gear tables**](#starting-gear-tables) to determine your hat, armour, tools, and equipment.

See the **Equipment List** for related armour, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.

Gunslingers should not start with a full inventory (all 10 slots in use), so consider working as a group to determine what items to carry.

### Gunslinger Creation Example

> Tabletop roleplaying gamer Amy (she/her) wants to create a Gunslinger in **We Deal in Lead**.
>
> Amy starts by rolling **d100** on the **first name** table and gets **76**, *Rebecca*. Amy likes the sounds so decides to keep it ("Becca for short.") For **surname**, Amy rolls **52**, *Kruse*. Amy decides Rebecca will use she/her **pronouns**. She then rolls a **d10** on the **background** table and gets **9**, *Drifter*. 
>
> Rebecca Kruse (she/her), the drifter. 
>
> Amy doesn’t know much about Rebecca at this point, so she rolls on the **Gunslinger traits** tables and gets the following results:
>
> She’s **short**, with **pockmarked skin**, **flowing hair**, a **chiselled face**, and **wary eyes**. She speaks in an **eloquent** manner, wears **road-worn clothing**, and is **tolerant** yet **ruthless**. She has a reputation of being **boisterous** and has been **heartbroken** in the past.
>
> Rebecca is starting to take shape in Amy’s mind. Now she rolls **4d12+10** for Rebecca's age and gets **40**.
>
> Next, Amy needs to determine what kind of **gun** Rebecca the gunslinger carries. She rolls a **d6** on the **Artefact Guns** table and gets **1**, **twin six shooters**. She now rolls **2d6** twice on the **Gun Embellishments** table and discovers the guns have **walnut grips** and are **engraved** with the image of a **sword**. Amy decides this should represent Excalibur.
>
> Now Amy needs to roll for Rebecca's **ability scores**. She rolls **3d6** three times and assigns the results to her abilities in order:
>
> **STR** 12
>
> **DEX** 8
>
> **HRT** 12
>
> Amy thinks Rebecca will be light on her feet at the cost of toughness, so she switches her **STR** and **DEX** scores, giving her: 
>
> **STR** 8
>
> **DEX** 12
>
> **HRT** 12
>
> Next, Amy rolls for Rebecca's **Grit**, representing her courage and resilience (and ability to avoid damage in combat). A roll of **2d6** for **Grit** gives **6**.
>
> Finally, Amy rolls on the **Starting Gear** tables to see what gear and equipment Rebecca has:
>
> She wears a black **preacher hat**, a **waxed cotton duster** (**1 DEF**), and a **bandolier** (frees up 1 slot for Lead). In her pack, she carries **3 days' rations**, a **cudgel**, **lantern and oil**, and a **bandana**. 
>
> For her **bonus item**, she rolls **19** on a **d20** and gets another **trinket**: a **compass**.
>
> Amy rolls **3d6** for Rebecca's starting **Lead** (both currency and ammo for her guns) and gets **9**. This means she can **reload** one gun a total of 9 times or both guns a total of 4 times (with 1 Lead left over).
>
> Hats and bandanas don't take up any slots, so Rebecca has 3 **inventory slots** free. Her guns take up one slot each so are classed as **bulky**. **Small** items can be combined into 1 slot. 
>
> Amy’s now finished creating her new gunslinger, Rebecca, who’s equipped and ready to set off into the Drifted World.


## Rules
### **Abilities**

Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

**Strength (STR**): Used for **critical damage** saves and saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX):** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Heart (HRT)**: Used for **gunslinger duels** and saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, carry out rituals, etc.

### **Saves**

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. Roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If you roll *equal to or under that ability score*, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

In some situations, saves are made with a bonus (**advantage**) or penalty (**disadvantage**). Roll two d20s, take the lower result for **advantage** and the higher for **disadvantage**.

### **Fatigue & Deprived**

**Fatigue.** Each point occupies **1 slot** in your inventory. PCs gain Fatigue when **deprived**, by using certain items, monster abilities, or through events in the fiction.

**Deprived.** Lacking a crucial need (such as food or rest) leaves you **deprived** and unable to recover **Grit** or ability scores. If you're deprived for more than a day, add **Fatigue** to your inventory, one for each day.

Fatigue and the deprived status last until you're able to recuperate (such as a full night’s rest in a safe spot).

### **Healing**

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost Grit but leaves your party exposed. Ability loss can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. 

Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or advanced means of recovery may come at a cost.

### **Defence**

While good at deflecting melee weapon attacks (from knives and clubs, for instance), armour is poor protection against guns, especially those wielded by gunslingers.

For melee attacks, before calculating damage to **Grit**, subtract the target's **Armour** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armour provides a bonus defence (ie. +1 DEF), but only while the item is held or worn. No one can have more than 3 DEF.

Guns fired by gunslingers or harriers bypass Defence and impact Grit directly.

Items like leather cuffs and helmets may provide additional benefits according to their use.

### **Reactions**

When the characters encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

#### **Reactions Table**

|    2    |    3-5    |  6-8   |    9-11    |   12    |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
| Helpful | Talkative | Unsure | Unfriendly | Hostile |

Consider the following table of motivations for NPCs as well:

#### What Do They Want?

| d10  | Want            | Description                                                  |
| :--: | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | **Food or Aid** | They’re hungry or hurt and need help                         |
|  2   | **Lead**        | They want d20 Lead: a tax, a toll, tribute, tithe, or they're just greedy |
|  3   | **Treasure**    | They want a number of items equal to the number of gunslingers |
|  4   | **Gun**         | They want one of your guns                                   |
|  5   | **Territory**   | This is their territory, they will defend it; they just want you to leave or prove why you should be able to pass through |
|  6   | **Information** | They want to know about a rival faction, nearby NPC or monster, landmark or location |
|  7   | **Help**        | They want your help with something: retrieve an item, kill a monster, or clear out an area |
|  8   | **Trade**       | They have items to trade; all trades are made at a higher mark-up |
|  9   | **Mission**     | They’re in service to the strongest force in the area; they seek to maintain that power |
|  10  | **Direction**   | They seek a guide or escort to a safe area                   |

### **Morale**

Enemies must succeed a HRT save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's HRT in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 Grit. 

Morale affects your party in unique ways (see [The Order of Gunslingers](#the-order-of-gunslingers)).

### **Inventory**

- You start with **10 inventory slots**: 1 slot for each hand, 2 slots for your upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head) and 6 in your satchel
- Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled
- Hats don't take up any slots
- **Lead** takes up 1 slot, unless you have a **bandolier** or similar ammo belt
- **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry
- Anyone with a **full inventory** (all slots filled) is reduced to **0 Grit**
- You can’t carry more items than your inventory allows, though **carts**, **mules**, and horses **may** provide an increase in slots
- **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment

### **Hirelings**

You can hire **hirelings** to aid in your expeditions. To create a hireling, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 Grit and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out.

Hirelings are not gunslingers but may quest to join the Order. If a Hireling becomes a gunslinger, they gain an additional 1d6 Grit.

Hirelings cost between 1-3 Lead per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

### **Wealth & Treasure**

The most valuable currency in We Deal in Lead is gun ammunition, known as **Lead**.

Less common is the gold piece (gp), rare to find and normally mixed with lesser metals.

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking you to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

## **The Order of Gunslingers**

If playing with 2 or more players, consider forming a gunslinger **Order**, a group joined in fellowship that offers strength in numbers.

Roll on the **Order** table to determine your Order name or choose one amongst the players.

### **Order**

| d20  | Order of…    |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 1    | The Fool     |
| 2    | The Flag     |
| 3    | The Rule     |
| 4    | Mystery      |
| 5    | The Bonfire  |
| 6    | The Wagon    |
| 7    | The Fist     |
| 8    | The Mount    |
| 9    | Coins        |
| 10   | The Gun      |
| 11   | The Gallows  |
| 12   | The Clearing |
| 13   | Control      |
| 14   | Old Scratch  |
| 15   | The King     |
| 16   | Etoi         |
| 17   | Lun          |
| 18   | Sol          |
| 19   | The Judge    |
| 20   | The Earth    |

### The Errant

One member of your order is designated as lead gunslinger, or **the Errant**. As a group, you and the other players should discuss and choose the Errant. This could be the gunslinger with the most experience, or the oldest, or the one that makes most narrative sense.

The Errant serves to aim and focus the Order, to shepherd the group on their Quest. When the time comes, the Errant may need to choose between the Order and the Quest.

Some gunslinger Orders choose to go without a Errant or work as a collective, deciding as a group on what direction to take.

### **Breaking the Order**

Even the strongest Gunslinger Order faces trials and adversity. If the unthinkable happens, the fellowship of the Order is tested.

When a member of the order **dies** or **loses their gun**, the Errant makes a **HRT** **save** to keep the order together. If they fail the save, the Order is **broken**.

For Orders with no Errant, the gunslinger with the highest **HRT** should make the save instead.

Fate is cruel to a broken order of gunslingers. You hand quivers more often. You lose your target more easily. The wind shifts at the last moment.

Members of a broken Order face a **+2 penalty** for every shot taken (every roll on the **Shoot** table).

A broken Order may be mended through unity and discovery, such as the following milestones:

**The Order...**

- ... forges a new Gunslinger
- ... defeats a major enemy
- ... unveils a mysterious truth
- ... saves the life of a Gunslinger
- ...fulfils a Quest

After one of these significant events, the Errant may attempt to re-forge the fellowship of the Order. They make another HRT save; success means the Order is made whole once again and the **-2 penalty** is removed.

When some Orders break, such as the result of a **sacrifice** (see below), they cannot be mended. A new Order must be formed with at least two different members.

## The Quest

The Quest is what drives a Gunslinger forward, the goal that propels them through The Drifted World. The Quest is not an adventure or a campaign, but the life goal of a Gunslinger.

The Quest materialises during the forging of a Gunslinger and shapes their past, present, and future.

- Locate and retrieve your elder's guns
- Hunt your elder's killer
- Restore your family's honour
- Reach the centre of The Drifted World
- Slay the demon within you
- Defeat the the eternal terror who rules the realm of dread

Fulfilling your Quest is a major achievement and often only comes at end of a Gunslinger's life, though one Quest may transition to a greater Quest or lead to an end to Gunslingling.

Your Quests may be secret, kept hidden from your Order, or they may be written openly on your face. The strongest Gunslinger Orders have quests that align, or at least aren't opposed.

There will be situations where Quests do oppose, or you might need to make a choice between fulfilling your Quest and maintaining the fellowship of your Order. In extreme situations, this could lead to **sacrifice**. Discuss these choices with the other players of the group as they could result in conflict.

### Sacrifice

The goal of your Quest is in reach, after lifetimes of searching. The resolution is almost at hand, but your goal starts slipping out of your grasp. What would you do to take that final step and fulfil your life's work? What would you sacrifice? 

**Sacrifice** means something different to everyone, but in simple terms: if given two outcomes, you choose the option that advances your Quest at a cost to your Order.

This cost could be tangible (the loss of a gun or the death of a Gunslinger) or abstract (betraying the Order's trust or crossing a moral line).

**Sacrifice** can result in a permanently broken Order, but can also lead to a major Quest revelation or even Quest fulfilment. Be sure to discuss these scenarios with the rest of the group, especially if the activity involves another player.

## Combat

### **Rounds**

- The game typically plays without strict time accounting
- In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs: a **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of **turns**

### **Actions**

- On their turn, characters can **move up to 40ft** and take one action (attack, move again, or some other reasonable action)
- Declare actions before rolling dice; if attempting something risky, the Warden calls for a save for the players or NPCs
- All actions, attacks, and movements occur simultaneously

### **Turns**

The Warden will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. Unless surprised, the gunslingers act before their opponents. If surprised, each character must make a DEX save to act first.

If facing off against another gunslinger, see [Duels](#duels).

### **Gunslinging**

#### **The Guns of a Gunslinger**

A gunslinger is nothing without their gun and most are handed down from elder to child. Firearms are exceedingly rare in The Drifted World but the guns of a gunslinger, also called **artefact guns** or **big iron**, are rarer still and draw immediate attention.

Even amongst other firearms, **artefact guns** stand apart — in craftsmanship, materials, and effectiveness. Each artefact gun is a **relic**, imbued with ancient magical essence (see [Relics](#relics)). Artefact guns are treated as **magical weapons** and can hurt and kill creatures immune to mundane attacks.

In addition to this, once per day in combat you can call upon the essence imbued within your artefact gun to reinvigorate yourself and strengthen your resolve:

**Steel Resolve.** Channel your will through your artefact gun and draw resolve from the steel. Make a **HRT save**; if successful, regain an amount of **Grit** equal to your gun's damage die. Causes **1 Fatigue**.

When travelling between worlds, artefact guns retain their magical properties.

Unlike melee weapons or other firearms, an artefact gun is not guaranteed to hit. When attacking with an artefact gun, roll on the **[Shoot](#shoot-table)** table to determine if your aim is true; anyone not a gunslinger who attempts to fire an artefact gun rolls on the **Shoot** table with **disadvantage **(roll 2d6 twice and take the higher result).

Also unlike melee weapons, in the hands of a gunslinger, guns ignore **armour**, making them especially deadly.

#### **Ammo and Reloading**

Each gun has different ammo capacity, corresponding to an appropriate die (d4, d6, etc.). Keep track of how many shots you have remaining by starting at the highest number on the die and reducing it by 1 after every shot, changing the die to the new number. For guns with only 2 shots (such as the scattergun), use a coin or token to track remaining shots.

- When you have no shots remaining, you must spend a turn **reloading** your gun
- Every reload costs **1 Lead** regardless of gun type

#### Shooting

Guns are unpredictable, even in the hands of an experienced gunslinger. When firing a gun in the heat of combat, roll on the **Shoot** table.

As a gunslinger, the bonds of fellowship influence how true your aim is or how cruel the fates can be. If your gunslinger order is **broken** (see **Breaking the Order**), add a +2 penalty to every **Shoot** roll.

##### **Shoot** Table

| 2d6   | Result                              |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | Maximum damage                      |
| 4-6   | Hit                                 |
| 7-9   | Graze (diminished damage, d4)       |
| 10-11 | Miss                                |
| 12    | Misfire (roll on the Misfire table) |

##### **Misfire**

| d6   | Result       | Consequence                                        |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2  | Click        | Nothing happens                                    |
| 3    | Duff load    | Lose **1 Lead**                                    |
| 4    | Gun jammed   | Action to clear                                    |
| 5    | Gun damaged  | Unable to use again without repair; gun is damaged |
| 6    | Gun explodes | Attacker takes weapon damage the and gun is ruined |

You can repair a **damaged gun** with a **gun care kit** but a **ruined gun** needs the skill of a **gunsmith** to repair (see [Gunsmithing](#gunsmithing)).

#### Special Attacks

Over time, gunslingers gain an expert level of proficiency with their guns. You can use this expertise to perform special attacks in combat, though the effort extracts a toll.

- Using each special attack adds **1 Fatigue** to your inventory
- When using a special attack, you only need to roll once on the **Shoot** table

Each gun type has a different special attack:

**Twin six shooters.** ***Two and Two*:** Fire twice from each gun, gain **damage advantage** against two different targets.

**Six shooter.** ***Fan the Hammer*:** Use both hands to rapidly fire all six shots, causes **blast** damage against up to six targets.

**Repeater.** ***Cry Pardon*:** Rapidly fire three shots, causes **blast** damage against up to three targets.

**Scattergun.** ***Give it Both Barrels*:** Fire both shots at once, gain **double damage** with a **blast** attack.

**Rifle.** ***Dead Eye:*** Remain motionless and gauge your target; a successful attack results in **max damage**.

In addition to this, all guns have the following special attack (causes **Fatigue**):

**Quick Draw:** Quicker than the eye, draw your gun from your holster and fire in one smooth motion.

#### Duels

If facing down another gunslinger, whether a disgraced harrier or member of an opposed Order, one gunslinger's mettle is tested against the other in a duel. Duels are high risk/high reward and should not be entered into lightly.

In a contest to see who draws and fires first, each side must make a **HRT** save (after all, a gunslinger does not kill with their gun but kills with their heart):

- If **one** side **fails** the save, the **winner's** shot **hits**
- If **both** sides **fail** the save, **both** shots **hit**
- If **both** sides **succeed** the save, the gunslinger with the **lowest** roll **hits** (if rolls are tied, the gunslinger with the highest **HRT** hits)

Hits in duels deal **STR** damage directly, bypassing **Grit** entirely, and trigger a **critical damage** save.

A roll of **1** on a **duel save** deals **maximum weapon damage** to the target's **STR** and forces a **critical damage** save.

When two gunslinger groups face off against each other, the **Errant** or lead gunslinger makes the **HRT** save for the group.

#### Gunsmithing

Scattered around the Drifted World, tucked away in isolated enclaves or behind fortress walls, are **gunsmiths**, expert crafters who can *repair*, *modify*, or even *forge* new **artefact guns**. These are rare individuals who keep a low profile and command a king's ransom for their work.

##### Repair

For a price and with the right components, a gunsmith can repair a **damaged** or **ruined** gun and may also sell **gun care kits**.

##### Modify

For the right price, a gunsmith can modify artefact guns to upgrade certain characteristics.

| Gun Type    | Modification       | Damage | Capacity | Range  | Qualities |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ------ | --------- |
| Six shooter | Quick Load         | d6     | 6        | Short  | reload    |
| Repeater    | Mare's Leg         | d8     | 8        | Medium |           |
| Scattergun  | Sawed-Off          | d8     | 2        | Short  | blast     |
| Rifle       | Expanded Cartridge | d8     | 6        | Long   | bulky     |

**Expanded Cartridge (rifle).** Replace the cartridge to allow for a higher shot capacity at the cost of damage.

**Mare's Leg (repeater).** Trim the length of the barrel and stock to reduce the gun's weight.

**Quick Load (six shooter).** Replace the cylinder to allow faster reloads (can reload and fire in one turn) at the cost of damage.

**Sawed-Off (scattergun).** Trim the length of the barrel and stock to reduce the scattergun's weight.

##### Forge

Only the most skilled gunsmiths will even attempt to forge new artefact guns, as the crafting process and ritual is intensive, dangerous, and requires an inordinate amount of knowledge and experience.

One or more of the following items are required:

- Gun schematic
- A block of pure blue-grey iron
- A block of pure rosewood, sandalwood, or ironwood
- Incantation for the ritual of binding

### **Attacking & Damage**

- Gun attacks bypass defence and reduce **Grit** directly
- Melee attacks lower **Grit** but damage is reduced by armour
- The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts their opponent's **defence**; the remainder is damage against the target’s **Grit**
- Unarmed attacks always do **1d4** damage

#### **Attack Modifiers**

**Multiple attackers.** If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

**Dual and 2-handed weapons.** If attacking with two weapons at the same time or one weapon held in both hands, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

**Diminished attacks.** If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **diminished** and the attacker must roll **1d4 damage** regardless of the attack's damage die.

**Enhanced attacks.** If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring manoeuvre), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll **1d12 damage** instead of their normal die.

### **Blast**

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Distance and Range

| Range  | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Close  | Close enough to smell someone's breath or engage in hand to hand combat |
| Short  | Within the same room or across the road; most revolvers and thrown weapons |
| Medium | The next hill over; long rifles and hunting bows             |
| Long   | Across the valley; the domain of high-powered rifles         |

### **Scars**

When damage to a PC reduces their Grit to exactly 0, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the **[Scars](#scars-table)** table for more.

### **Critical Damage**

- Once a target reaches **0 Grit**, any additional damage reduces **STR** directly and triggers a **critical damage** save
- The target must roll under **STR** to avoid **critical damage** (this includes characters, NPCs, and monsters)
- If you suffer **critical damage** you can't do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, you will stabilize. If left untreated, you die within the hour
- Certain enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save

### **Ability Score Loss**

If your STR is reduced to 0, you die. If your DEX is reduced to 0, you are incapacitated. If your HRT is reduced to 0, you are delirious.

Complete DEX and HRT loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means. 

### Poison

Some monsters and environmental hazards inflict poison. If you're poisoned, add **poison** to your inventory, which takes up **1 slot**. For every day poisoned, lose **1d4 STR**.

Poison can be cured by specialised healing or specific items.

### Death

All Gunslingers will eventually find their way to the clearing at the end of the path, but not all deaths are final. After all, death is but another door.

If your gunslinger dies and steps off the path into the clearing, you are free to create a new character or take control of a hireling (who may or may not have quested to join the Order).

As the death of a gunslinger is a terrible thing, the order's Errant is responsible for maintaining the fellowship. The Errant must make a HRT save to keep the order together (see [Breaking the Order](#breaking-the-order)).

### **Detachments**

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

- Attacks against detachments by individuals are **diminished** (excluding blast damage)

- Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage

### **Retreat**

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### **Scars** Table

When an attack reduces a your Grit to exactly 0, you are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:

|      | Result                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Scarred:** Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max Grit, take the new result. |
| 2    | **Rattled:** You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you re-focus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max Grit, take the new result. |
| 3    | **Concussed:** You stumble and knock your head. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max Grit. |
| 4    | **Broken**: You take a spill and break something. Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Lose 1d4 DEX. You need extended rest and healing to recover. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max Grit, take the new result. |
| 5    | **Bloodied:** You've lost a lot of blood. Lose 1d4 STR. After extended resting and healing, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max Grit, take the new result. |
| 6    | **Touched:** You glimpse a vision of another world, another time. Gain knowledge of the nearest slip door. |
| 7    | **Beckoned:** Someone reaches out from another world and begins visiting your dreams. Resting no longer clears Fatigue and you must Quest to locate them. |
| 8    | **Forewarned:** You see a vision of your death. Make a HRT save. If you succeed, increase your max HRT by 1d4. |
| 9    | **Fractured:** Memories from a parallel life surface in your mind. Make a HRT save. If you fail, you must undertake a ritual to confront and align your two lives or you'll go insane within a month. |
| 10   | **Maimed:** An eye or limb is severed, destroyed, or rendered useless. The Warden will tell you which. Then, make a HRT save. If you succeed, increase your max HRT by 1d6. |
| 11   | **Haunted:** You glimpse the clearing at the end of the path. A cloaked figure stares back and walks slowly towards you. Make a HRT save. If you fail, the figure begins to haunt you. You must undertake a ritual to confront and dispel this apparition. |
| 12+  | **Doomed:** You near the clearing at the end of the path, but somehow you survive. If you fail your next save against critical damage, you die. If you succeed, the experience leaves you with a greater understanding of your Quest. |

### Combat Example

> *Rebecca (Amy) and Gred (Ralph) enter the deserted village, guns drawn. Rebecca has a six shooter and Gred has a scattergun.*
>
> Amy: Rebecca scans the left side of the street for any movement.
>
> Ralph: And Gred will watch the right side.
>
> Warden: A thug with a dagger pops out on the left, but you clock him as you're on alert. He's raised his dagger as if to throw it.
>
> Amy: I fire! 
>
> *Amy rolls 2d6 on the Shoot table and gets 10. A miss!* 
>
> Warden: Bad luck! You've got 5 shots left.
>
> *Amy changes her d6 ammo counter from 6 to 5.*
>
> Warden: The thug throws the dagger at Rebecca.
>
> *The warden rolls d6 for the dagger's damage and returns a 5. Rebecca's wearing a waxed cotton duster which gives 1 DEF so the damage from the dagger is reduced to 4. Rebecca marks 4 damage to her Grit, leaving 2.*
>
> Amy: Ouch! I clear my mind and slow my breathing, focusing on my target. I fire again.
>
> *Amy rolls 2d6 again and gets 7, a grazing hit. Instead of her standard d8 for damage, she rolls a d4 for diminished damage and gets 2.*
>
> Warden: OK, the thug takes the round in his shoulder but he's still coming. Gred, you spot another two pop out on the right side.
>
> Ralph: I grit my teeth and fire the scattergun! 
>
> *Ralph rolls on the shoot table and gets 5, a solid hit. He only gets 2 shots with the scattergun before reloading, so he flips over a two-sided token to show he's got one left.*
>
> Warden: Nice shot! You hit both of them with that!
>
> *Gred's scattergun does blast damage so Ralph rolls for damage twice, once for each thug. Two 7s! Both thugs have 6 Grit, so this attack takes them both under 0. They take the extra damage directly to their STR, reducing it to 9.*
>
> Warden: Both thugs stagger back from the force of the scattergun. They're both hurt pretty bad.
>
> *For each thug, the warden rolls a d20 for a critical damage save. The target is 9 or under, as this is their current STR. The first thug gets 6, success! He's still standing. The second thug gets a 10, which is a failure.*
>
> Warden: The first thug grits his teeth in pain but he's still standing. The second collapses to the ground, dead.
>
> Ralph: Yes!
>
> Warden: The remaining thug, seeing his friend die in front of him, feels fear run up his spine.
>
> *The warden makes a morale check for the thug. Since thugs are cowards, they make morale checks with disadvantage. The warden rolls a d20 twice for the HRT save and gets 6 and 19. 6 would normally be a success but the warden takes the higher roll due to disadvantage. 19 is a failure as the thug's HRT is only 8.*
>
> Warden: The thug's courage breaks and he runs away screaming.
>
> Amy: Yes, nice one, Gred!
>
> Warden: A figure in a long duster steps from the shadows, black hat pulled low and with a hand on a revolver on their belt. They tip their hat, sneering.
>
> Amy: Malachai! So you finally decided to crawl out of that hole. 
>
> Warden: The figure smiles and says, "The clearing awaits Rebecca. Soon you'll join your beloved there."
>
> Amy: Rebecca drops a hand to her six shooter and screams "Fill your hand, you sonuvabitch!"
>

## Wilderness Exploration

### Hex Crawling

Each hex represents 6 miles. An adventuring day is divided into 6 turns of approximately 4 hours each. Two of these phases, approximately 8 hours, must be spent sleeping in order to avoid becoming **deprived**. In each turn, the following procedure is followed:

1. **Action:** The party decides on one exploration action for that turn.
2. **Event Roll:** The Warden rolls on the event die for encounters and other random events.
3. **Resolution:** The action and event rolls are resolved.

### Exploration Actions

The party may choose one of the following standard actions each 4-hour turn.

1. **Travel:** passing through a hex and into an adjacent one. On roads marked on the map, the party travels through two hexes (three if mounted). Off-road, one hex is traversed. There is also a 2-in-6 chance, when traveling off-road, of getting lost. This is increased to 3-in-6 in hexes classified as difficult terrain. An experienced hunter decreases the chance of getting lost by 1-in-6. If players get lost, they will need to spend the next turn using the “search” action to reorient themselves. The effects of getting lost are rolling a d6, assigning a number to each side of the current hex, and moving the players one hex off course in that direction.
2. **Explore:** Looking for interesting features within a hex. There is a 4-in-6 chance of discovering the main location in the hex description. Difficult terrain reduces this to 3-in-6. An experienced hunter increases the chance by 1-in-6.
3. **Search:** Looking for something which was previously encountered in a hex. The basic chance is 5-in-6 or 4-in-6 in difficult terrain. An experienced hunter, shaman, or stranger increases the chance by 1-in-6.
4. **Interact:** Staying in the current location (e.g. exploring a dungeon, town, etc).
5. **Camp:** Resting and/or sleeping.
6. **Forage:** Hunt, fish, or forage for food. There is a basic 3-in-6 chance of success. An experienced hunter, shaman, or stranger increases the chance.

### Event Roll

The Warden rolls 1d6 and consults the table appropriate to the party’s location.

1. **Encounter:** Roll on an [encounter table](#wilderness-encounters) for that terrain type or location.
2. **Sign:** Clue, spoor, or indication of nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby hex.
3. **Locality:** Shifts in weather, terrain, or other local changes.
4. **Expiration:** Exhaustion (Rest next turn or add 1 fatigue), hunger (Eat a ration or add 1 fatigue), or another resource is needed.
5. **Discovery:** Discover something useful such as food, treasure, or other resources.
6. **Hidden Feature:** The main feature of the hex is discovered, or, choose or roll randomly for a unique hex feature from a random table. Options include small dungeons, secret areas, factions, etc.

## **Other Worlds (WIP)**

The Drifted World endures on the edge of the known realms, though links and portals between the worlds continue to exist, such as slip doors and magical gateways.

### Slip doors

Slip doors are freestanding doorways that can lead to other worlds, other times, or other places in the Drifted World. Like much in the Drifted World, the true origin of these doors was lost when the world moved on, but the wise folk believe they're the result of an arcane amalgam of science and magic.

When closed, most slip doors appear like mundane wooden doors, though constructed from rarer materials like rosewood or ironwood. Typically, an engraving or carving on the door will indicate where the slip door leads, though these can be cryptic or obscured.

When open, slips doors allow passage from either side but most are one-way only and disappear once closed at the destination.

Thanks to the magic imbued in their artefact guns, gunslingers have the ability to see and open slip doors, which are invisible to most others.

### Magical gateways

Unlike the fairly stable and consistent slip doors, the magical gateways that exist in the Drifted World are dangerous and unpredictable, often requiring a **ritual** to activate. These are imbued with old magic and are often the home of spirits or demons.

### Hazards

#### Chaos Slip

A tear in the fabric of the Drifted World, bleeding into a realm beyond reality. Operate on the same principles as slip doors but are several orders of magnitude more dangerous and chaotic. Chaos slips emit ear-shattering shrieks that both repel and attract those close enough to hear them, forcing a **STR save** to avoid temporarily hearing loss and a **HRT save** to avoid the desire to move closer.

Hideous black tentacles burst forth and will envelop and then dismember any creature standing within short range of a chaos slip.

#### The Eater Outside

Something slithers through the spaces between worlds, consuming and growing, surviving out of focus from mundane existence. This is the **Eater Outside**, a colossal entity that incrementally erodes the structures of reality. The wise folk say that one day the Eater will ultimately topple the wheel and send existence spinning off into the void.

The Eater Outside rarely discerns individual life in the Drifted World, though certain activities like the catastrophic failure of a ritual can draw its unprecedented and obliterative attention.

### Travel into and outside the Drifted World

**Travelling outside the Drifted World:**

- Artefact guns maintain their special properties when travelling into other worlds
- Lead becomes even rarer, though gunslingers may find suitable alternative ammunition in certain worlds
- A **[Revalc Box](#relics)** is useful for gunslingers as this converts **gold** (gp) into **Lead**

**Travelling into the Drifted World:**

- Magic behaves unpredictably, often with disastrous results (see the [Lost Magic](#lost-magic-table) table)

- Gold coins have little value in smaller settlements but great value in cities

  

## Magic

Organised and written magic in the form of spellbooks no longer exists. In The Drifted World, magic is an obscure, hidden, and largely lost discipline and there are places of great energies spread across worlds known and unknown.

### Rituals

Most magic in The Drifted World takes the form of **rituals**. These are ceremonies and incantations whispered from one dark practitioner to another, broken and twisted through the repetition, true meanings and origins lost. No two rituals are the same and all represent a tangible threat to those involved and in proximity.

Rituals require a suitable **location**, a place steeped in old magic or significant meaning, such as standing stones, graveyards, temples, or churches.

There are normally four components to a ritual: **Intent**, **Cost**, **Result**, and **Aftermath**.

**Intent.** What is the desired outcome? 

- Cleanse the body or spirit
- Speak with the dead
- Consult an oracle
- Reach across worlds

The more complex the intent, the higher the cost and the more difficult the ritual.

**Cost.** What is the price to reach that outcome? What do you need to exchange to manifest your intent? This can be physical, spiritual, or metaphorical. This can include:

- A drop of blood
- A burned offering
- A painful secret, long locked away
- A piece of your soul

**Result.** What shape does the outcome take? How successful was the attempt?

The gunslinger undertaking the ritual must pay the cost and seek inside themselves for the outcome. Make a **HRT** save to determine whether or not the ritual can even begin. 

If successful, roll **3d6** on the **Rituals** table. Failure results in the temporary loss of **d6** **HRT**. The cost is not collected.

As with everything, the bonds of fellowship strengthen a gunslinger Order. If undertaking the ritual as a group, make the **HRT** save with **advantage**. If successful, roll **3d6** on the **Rituals** table. Failure threatens the fellowship of the Order (see [Breaking the Order](#breaking-the-order)).

If the intent is especially complex or difficult, roll on the Rituals table with a **+2 penalty**. If the intent is nearly impossible, roll with a **+4 penalty**.

#### Rituals Table

| 3d6   | Result                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3     | Favour and boon; the Great Turtle smiles upon you            |
| 4-6   | Favour                                                       |
| 7-9   | Favour with complication                                     |
| 10-11 | Complication                                                 |
| 12-14 | Sorrow                                                       |
| 15-17 | Sorrow with complication                                     |
| 18    | You draw the ire of the Eater Outside; make a critical damage save or be torn from this world |

**Favour** is largely positive and represents a level of success in the ritual. **Sorrow** is largely negative and represents a level of failure in the ritual. A **complication** adds an extra obstacle or development.

The ritual's intent influences what form the favour and sorrow takes. For instance, if you seek to confront the apparition that haunts you, favour could see you make peace with the apparition and sorrow could see it grow more aggressive or drag itself into your world.

**Aftermath.** How have those involved been changed? What attention does the ritual draw, either in this world or others? How has the ritual impacted on the fellowship of the Order?

### Lost Magic

Magic from other worlds operates unpredictably in The Drifted World, often with disastrous or monstrous results. Some spirits or demons feed on this magic and seek it out. 

When you're in the Drifted World and attempt to cast magic brought from another world, roll on the **Lost Magic** table.

#### Lost Magic Table

| 2d6   | Result                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2-3   | The spell succeeds                                           |
| 4-6   | The spell mostly succeeds but has an unintended effect       |
| 7-9   | The spell fails                                              |
| 10-11 | The spell fails and has an unintended effect                 |
| 12    | The spell tears open a [chaos slip](#chaos-slip) at the site of casting |

The unintended effects depend on the nature of the spell and the intent of the caster, but could include:

- Reversed intent
- Magnified impact (range, number of targets, damage)
- Spell reflected back on the caster
- Summoned demon or spirit

### **Relics**

**Relics** are extremely rare items that retain power beyond current understanding, whether magical or technological. They do not cause **Fatigue**. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge condition. A few examples:

**Eye of Woden**, *1 charge*. Crystalline orb with brilliant red flaw. Grants a glimpse into a chosen world. **Recharge**: Bathe the Eye in the tears of a god.

**Grow Bag**, *3 charges*. Simple-looking worn leather bag with a polished stone closure. Manifest a shining gold coin from the depths. **Recharge**: Grant succour to someone in need with no desire for reward.

**Revalc Box**, *1 use per day*. Small unadorned ironwood box with brass latch. Converts 19 gold pieces into 1 Lead.

## **Beast Companions**

In The Drifted World, the call of the gunslinger transcends humanity. Other beings may join your order and aid in your quest, including beast companions. You will rarely encounter such beasts, but you'll be able to recognise the spirit of a gunslinger within.

A beast companion normally bonds to one member of the order, forging a lifelong friendship and empathic link.

### Types of Beast Companions

#### Bumbler

3 Grit, 8 STR, 12 DEX, 14 HRT, claws (d4)

- Tough, squat, tenacious; somewhere between a dog and a raccoon; attuned to detect agents of chaos
- Easily trained

#### Dog

3 Grit, 8 STR, 8 DEX, 12 HRT, bite (d4)

- Fiercely loyal and dependable; larger breeds add d4 STR, smaller breeds add d4 DEX
- Easily trained

#### Feral cat

2 Grit, 8 STR, 12 DEX, 10 HRT, claws (d4)

- Natural killer, not to be underestimated; clever and agile
- Difficult to train

#### Hawk

2 Grit, 8 STR, 15 DEX, 8 HRT, talons (d4)

- They say a hawk is God's gunslinger; ferocious and deadly but fragile, with excellent sight
- Difficult to train

#### Mongoose

2 Grit, 8 STR, 14 DEX, 8 HRT, bite (d4)

- Incredibly agile and resistant to poison
- Difficult to train

#### Wolf

4 Grit, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 9 HRT, bite (d6)

- Slow to bond but with a natural killer instinct
- Difficult to train

### Training

A newly bonded beast companion is still a wild animal, even though a gunslinger at their heart. Their bonded gunslinger may choose to train them in order to strengthen the bond and improve their effectiveness in combat.

A gunslinger must spend time each day for a week training their bonded beast. After a week, following the final training session, the gunslinger makes a HRT save; a success means the beast is now trained. Beasts that are easy to train (such as dogs) gain advantage on the HRT save.

### Combat

Unless trained, beast companions act unpredictably and are difficult to command in combat. An untrained companion will only attack their bonded gunslinger's target in combat and must make a Morale check when reduced to 0 Grit.

Trained beast companions gain the following benefits:

- +1d6 **Grit**
- Attack any target on command
- **Advantage** on **Morale** saves

### Death

As with any other member of the order, the death of a beast companion tests the fellowship of the order. Even if the Errant manages to weather the hardship and keep the Order together, the beast-bonded gunslinger feels the loss of their companion most acutely. They must make a HRT save or permanently lose 1d4 HRT to heartbreak.

## Solo Play

### Introduction

**We Deal in Lead** can also be played solo, with one player acting as both Warden and Gunslinger.

When you reach a moment of choice or conflict, a time when you’d normally look to the Warden to facilitate the outcome, consider consulting an Oracle, a method of deriving meaning from randomness.

An Oracle can be a set of tarot cards, a system from another TTRPG, an online resource, or a mobile app.

**We Deal in Lead** includes a set of random tables that serves as Oracle, offering a way to interpret random rolls and tarot cards from the Major Arcana to determine the result of a choice or action.

### Journaling

Chronicle your journey through the delve in a journal or diary. Be as brief or descriptive as you like — this is a tale of your Gunslinger, full details lost in the shifting of time and space.

### Favour or Sorrow

If an outcome isn’t immediately clear, ask a question of the Oracle. If it’s a simple yes or no answer (“Does the outlaw see me?”) or a straight-forward check (“Can I convince the seer to help me?”), roll 2d6 on the **Favour or Sorrow** table.

An outcome of **favour** is broadly **positive** while an outcome of **sorrow** is broadly **negative**. A **complication** adds an extra obstacle or development to the outcome.

For instance, you convince the seer to help you but they demand one of your rations in exchange.

#### Favour or Sorrow

| 2d6  | Outcome                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 2    | Favour                   |
| 3-6  | Favour with complication |
| 7    | Complication             |
| 8-11 | Sorrow                   |
| 12   | Sorrow with complication |

### Reading the Cards

For more complicated questions, or for more nuanced interactions, consult the cards for an answer.

First, gather your will and determine your focus. Narrow that focus to a singular emotion and concentrate on the 22 cards of the Major Arcana. One card name will reveal itself.

Generate your **focus** by rolling a **d10** on the **Focus** table. Generate your **emotion** by rolling a **d8** on the **Emotion** table. Finally, generate your **Card** by rolling a **d20** on the **Major Arcana** table or **drawing a card** from a **Major Arcana tarot deck**.

Reflect upon the resulting phrase and turn it over in your mind. Focus your emotion on the name of the rune. Your answer will soon take shape.

For instance, Amy wants to investigate a decaying colossus staggering around crumbling ruins. She rolls 3 dice: d10 for Focus (4 – *Greet*), d8 for Emotion (5 – *Crestfallen*), and d20 for Arcana (12 – *Death*).

This gives her *Greet Crestfallen Death*. She interprets this as a sign to avoid the colossus as it would surely lead to her demise.

#### Focus

| 1    | Observe  |

## Converting Adventures (WIP)

Given the inter-connected nature of the Drifted World, gunslingers may find themselves in vastly different worlds than their own. Wardens may decide to run a gunslinger order through adventures in other settings or genres.

### General Guidelines

- Only gunslingers (and others who roll on the **Shoot** table) bypass defence/armour with their guns

- Treat firearms fired by non-gunslingers the same way as melee weapons (armour reduces damage)

- Gunslingers have higher Grit than most adventurers and their guns are more powerful than mundane weapons; consider tweaking the challenge accordingly to best fit the group

  

**Converting Cairn/Into the Odd adventures:**

- **HP** becomes **Grit**
- **Will** becomes **Heart**
- **Armour** becomes **Defence**

**Converting Runecairn adventures:**

- **Resilience** becomes **Grit**
- Average of **Wits** and **Spirit** (round up) becomes **Heart**
- Gunslingers exist outside the skein and cannot interact with **bonfires** (no reviving) or benefit from **Iðunn's mead**
- Enemies still drop **Souls** when defeated but these heal the gunslingers for d4 ability damage
- **Soul remnants** can be used in **rituals**



## Bestiary

#### Ankheg

7 Grit, 2 DEF, 16 STR, 8 DEX, 8 HRT, bite (d8)

-  Huge insectoid with multiple legs and shiny black eyes

-  Stay burrowed just beneath the surfaces to ambush creatures walking above

-  Sprays acid on distant enemies for d10 damage

#### Banshee

8 Grit, 3 DEF, 6 STR, 12 DEX, 15 HRT, ghostly touch (d8)

-  Incorporeal spirit that lingers after death and haunt the living
-  Mundane weapons have no effect
-  Keen: Releases a piercing death shriek, all targets in short range must make a Critical Damage save

#### Bear

6 Grit, 14 STR, 6 DEX, 8 HRT, claw (d6+d6 blast), bite (d8)

- Aggressive, 9’ tall reddish-brown furred bear who lives in mountains. Prefers to eat meat
- Frequently found sleeping
- Critical damage:  Crush victims for d8 damage

#### **Bestial**

8 Grit, 1 DEF, 12 STR, 10 DEX, 10 HRT, sabre (d8), bite (d6)

- Humanoid body with the head of a beast (vulture, rat, coyote); mid-ranking servants of chaos
- Sharp and cunning; utilise low men as their eyes, ears, and muscle
- Bite carries rot and infection; STR save to avoid becoming deprived

#### Blood Elk

3 Grit, 12 STR, 13 DEX, 5 HRT, horns (d8)

### Creating Monsters
Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or NPC:

**Name**
X Grit, X DEF, X STR, X DEX, X HRT, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

**General Principles**
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.

- Give average creatures 3 Grit, give hardy ones 6 Grit, and serious threats get 10+ Grit.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Remember that Grit is **damage avoidance**, not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

**Converting from OSR Games**

- Give 1 Grit per HD for most creatures.
- Most humanoids have at least 4 Grit.
- **Morale** can also be used as a baseline.

Some pointers:
- Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it Grit.
- Does it soak up damage? Give it **DEF**.
- Is it strong? Give it a high **STR**.
- Is it nimble? Give it high **DEX**.
- Is it charismatic? Give it high **HRT**.

Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6 damage.
